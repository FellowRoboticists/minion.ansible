minion.ansible
==============

The Ansible configuration for minion client and server machines.

Description
-----------

The point of this project is to determine how one might use Ansible
to configure up minion client machines and server machines, including
dealing with all the secrets that need to be passed along.

It is not complete at this point since I'm still learning how to use 
Ansible. More details will be provided when available.
